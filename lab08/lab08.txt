Write a program called lab08.c that 
  -prompts the user for a character and then a string.
  -REMOVES all occurrences of that character from the string, and 
  -prints the changed string forwards and backwards.

The program must: 
  -use a macro (#define) to set MAX to 100 (maximum length of string is 99).
  -define and use functions:
     void squeeze( char c, char S[] ) ; /* removes all occurrences of c from S */
     void printBackwards( char S[] ) ;  /* prints string in reverse */
  -exit or return with code 0 (zero)
  -behave exactly like given program lab08 

The program may: 
  -use gets if you wish

You may Assume:
   -user always gives correctly formatted input.

Note:
   -when you pass an array/string to a function, any changes the function
    makes to that array/string are permanent.
