Write a C program as follows.

INPUT:

  Program expects N+1 lines of input. The first line is some non-negative 
  integer, N.  The remaining N lines each contain an integer.
  Assume the user enters proper input.  For example, the files in1, in2, 
  in3, and in4 all contain proper input.

OUTPUT:

  The program outputs a table such as the following, where x is the maximum
  value of the N integers, n is the minimum value, t is the total, and a is
  the average. Note that the values MUST be lined up using tabs "\t":
  ----------------------------------------
  Number Processed:       N
  Maximum:                x
  Minimum:                n
  Total:                  t
  Average:                a
  ----------------------------------------

EXIT CODE VALUE:
  Program exits with 1 if N was greater than zero.
  Program exits with 0 if N was zero.

FORMATTING:
  Make your code as readable as possible by indenting appropriately.

FUNCTIONS and FILES:
  The main function is in file lab07M.c
  The printTable function is in file lab07F.c
  The printTable function prototype is in file lab07F.h

EXAMPLE:
A sample executable program is given in program: lab07Solution
Here is an example of running it using input from file in1
>lab07Solution <in1
--------------------------------------------
Number Processed:       7
Maximum:                564
Minimum:                -9
Total:                  867
Average:                123.857143
--------------------------------------------
>

You should have created these files:
  lab07M.c   
  lab07F.c   
  lab07F.h   
  lab07      (the executable program)
