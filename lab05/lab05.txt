CPS393 Lab05 

   Write a shell program named lab05 that takes 2 or more command line arguments.
   Arguments are expected to be readable files. If there are no "issues", then 
   lab05 prints, on stdout, the names of the files with the fewest/most lines, 
   and their respective linecounts, as follows:
       file xx has fewest lines (f)
       file yy has most lines (m)
   where 
     out of all the readable files on the command line,
     xx has the fewest lines (f lines), and yy has the most lines (m lines).

   Possible "issues":
   -----------------

   -less than 2 command line arguments are given. In this case, print the 
    following on standard error, where "lab05" is the name of the program, 
    but is NOT hardcoded:
    lab05: 2 or more command line arguments are required

   -no valid files are given on the command line arguments (e.g., files do not
    exist, or are not readable, or arguments are directories, not files, etc.)
    In this case, print the following on standard error, where "lab05" is the name 
    of the program, but is NOT hardcoded:
    lab05: no valid files

    -only one valid file is given on the command line (e.g., all-but one of the files 
    specified were invalid files, or directories, etc.)
     In this case, print the 2 lines as in "no issues" above, but the same file is
     listed for both xx and yy.

    Exit codes:
    1 if something was printed on standard error
    0 otherwise

   Example of running lab05 (where ">" is my prompt):
   >ls -l
   total 4
