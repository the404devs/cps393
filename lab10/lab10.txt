Write a program named addTo.c that takes 3 command line arguments
as follows:
 -The first argument is an integer.
 -The second argument is a readable file (which contains some number 
  of integers, one per line.
 -The third argument is the name of a file that can be opened for write.

After your program finishes, the second file will be a copy of
the first, except that each integer in the file will be increased
by X, where X is the the integer given in the first command line argument.

e.g.,
> gcc -o addTo addTo.c
> cat file1
2
3
6
100
> ./addTo 2 file1 file2
> cat file2
4
5
8
102
> ./addTo -5 file1 file2
> cat file2
-3
-2
1
95
> ./addTo 3 
usage: ./addTo <integer> <infile> <outfile>

ERROR CHECKING:
If any input is invalid, your program should print an appropriate
error message on standard error (including the program name).
Things you must check: 
  -exactly 3 command line arguments
  -first command line argument is an integer (must use function
   isInt below to determine this).
  -second command line argument is a readable file
  -third command line argument is the name of a file that can be
   opened for write

ASSUME:
  -the first file contains appropriate input, which is:
    Zero or more lines.  Each line contains one integer.

FUNCTIONS:
  -you must create/use at least the following function:
       int isInt ( char *S ) ;
   Function isInt returns: 
    -true  (1) if string S contains only digits (with perhaps
     a '-' at the start to indicate a negative integer).
    -false (0) otherwise

Submit: addTo.c
        addTo
