CPS393 Lab06 

1. Write a shell program named lab06 that ignores any command line arguments.
   The program reads some number of lines from standard input. Each line must
   be of the form:  o i
   where 
   where "o" is either '+' or '-', and
   where "i" is an integer.
   If valid input is given, the program prints a single integer, which is the 
   result of the mathematical operation. The program prints its result when
   it reaches the end-of-input (ctrl-d on keyboard, or EOF if stdin redirected).

   Examples, where ">" is my prompt:
   > lab06 
   - 5
   + 3
   Result: -2
   >
   > lab06 
   + 3 
   + 1 
   - 3 
   + 1 
   Result: 2
   >
   > lab06 
   - 5
   Result: -5
   >

   If the program gets any invalid input, it prints nothing on stdout, but prints
   the following on stderr (where lab06 is NOT hardcoded).
   lab06: invalid input
   

    Exit codes:
    1 if something was printed on standard error
    0 otherwise
