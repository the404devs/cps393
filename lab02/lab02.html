CPS393 LAB 02: 
   Glob constructs and commands:  cd, ls, pwd, cp, mkdir, vim, chmod, grep

------------------------------------
 Part 1
------------------------------------

1. Move around directories, list entries in directories, and verify current directory
   using:  cd, ls, pwd commands as follows:

   Move into your home directory:  cd
   Move into the course directory: cd /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/
   List the entries there:         ls
   Change into the labs directory  cd labs
   List the entries there:         ls
   Change into the first lab       cd lab01
   List the entries there:         ls

   Change back into your HOME directory:  cd
   Move back-and-forth between your home directory and the preivous directory
   (/usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/labs/lab01) by using the following command over and over:
   cd -
   Each time you change directories, verify you are in the correct directory by
   using the following command:
   pwd

2. Use mkdir to create directories as follows:
   Move into your home directory:  cd
   Verify you are there:           pwd
   Make directory cps393:          mkdir cps393
   Verify it was created:          ls
   Move into dir cps393:           cd cps393
   Verify you are there:           pwd
   Make dir labs:                  mkdir labs
   Verify it was created:          ls
   Move into dir labs:             cd labs
   Make directories lab01, lab03, lab04, ... lab09:
                                   mkdir lab01 lab02 lab03 lab04 lab05 lab06 lab07 lab08 lab09
   Verify they were created:       ls
   Move into lab02:                cd lab02


3. Use cp to copy file(s):
   Move into the lab02 directory in the course account:
                                   cd /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/labs/lab02
                                   pwd
                                   ls
   Move into your own lab02 dir:   cd ~/cps393/labs/lab02
   Verify you are there:           pwd
   Copy file myInfo.txt from the course lab02 dir into your own lab02 dir:
            cp /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/labs/lab02/myInfo.txt .
   Verify it was copied over:      ls
   Copy file vimTutorial.txt from your home dir into your lab01 dir:
                                   cd
                                   ls
                                   cp vimTutorial.txt cps393/labs/lab01/. 
   Verify your lab01 dir contains vimTutorial.txt and your lab02 dir contains myInfo.txt 
                                   cd
                                   cd cps393/labs
                                   pwd
                                   ls lab01
                                   ls lab02
   If they're not there, repeat the above.


4. Fill in myInfo.txt file:
   Move into your lab02 dir:       cd 
                                   cd cps393
                                   cd labs/lab02
                                   pwd
                                   ls
   Edit myInfo.txt:                vim myInfo.txt
   NOW USE VIM TO FILL IN YOUR NAME, SID, LOGIN, WHERE INDICATED, LEAVING
   A SPACE AFTER EACH COLON



5. Look at the man page for the ls command:  man ls
   Find an option of the "ls" command that lists directory contents so that color is 
   used to distinguish file types. 

   Remember: when you're in a man page, "space bar" goes down a page, "b" goes back up a page,
   "enter" goes down one line, "/abc" searches for the string "abc", "n" searches for the
   next "abc", "q" quits the man page.


------------------------------------
 Part 2
------------------------------------

1. Move into your cps393 directory 
   From within cps393, do the ls command with the option you found above (so the contents 
   will be listed in color.)
   Use output redirection (the ">" character) to capture the output of this ls command into
   a file named lab02q01

2. Use chmod to change some permissions on your files/dirs as follows:
   file myInfo.txt has permissions rw- for user, --x for group, and --- for other.
   directory labs has permissions  rwx for user, r-x for group, and --- for other.
   
3. Move into your home directory and verify you're there.

   From within your home directory, use the ls command to get a long listing for 
   myInfo.txt and labs as follows:
   Specify myInfo.txt using an ABSOLUTE path name. 
   Specify labs       using an RELATIVE path name. 
   Your command should look like the following (with ### replaced appropriately)":
   ls -ld ######myInfo.txt ######labs
   Use the mouse to copy and paste the actual ls command you used into file lab02q03:
      -"select" whole ls command with the mouse so it's hilighted (which is "copy" in putty). 
      -vim lab02q3
      -open a new line: o
      -right-click mouse (which is "paste" in putty)
      -press escape a couple of times
      -:wq to save and exit

   Use vim to edit lab02q03 again and add the following at the top to turn it into a 
   shell program:
#!/bin/bash

4. Use output redirection (the ">") to capture the OUTPUT from your ls command from
   question 3, and put it into file lab02q04

5. Copy the whole directory  /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/labs/lab02/testfiles into your
   own filespace UNDER your lab02 dir. 

6.  Write a shell program named lab02q06 as follows.
    The shell program uses glob constructs and ls to list all entries that have 
    2 or more dots "." in their name. 
     If you run your program from within your testfiles directory, it should list 
     these files (in any order):
     a.b.c  a.b.c.d  a.bbb.c

7.  Write a shell program named lab02q07 as follows.
    The shell program uses glob constructs to list all files ending in the string ".txt"
    If you run your program from within your testfiles directory, it should list files:
    u894g.txt  xyz.txt
   
8.  Write a shell program named lab02q08 as follows.
    The shell program uses grep to find all lines of all files that contain the string 
    "winter" with letters in any case (e.g., winter, or wiNTer, etc).
    If you run your program from within your testfiles directory, it should show: 
    abcdtxt: lfj; ak winter alksdjf 
    try1.aaa:The Wintertime lab
    u894g.txt: lfj; ak winter alksdjf 
    xyz:The WINTER lab

9.  Copy your lab02q08 to file lab02q09 and change lab02q09 so that instead of
    searching for the string "winter" in any case, it searches for a string
    given on the command line (in any case). For example, running the following
    should produce the same output as q8 above:
    ./lab02q9 winTER
