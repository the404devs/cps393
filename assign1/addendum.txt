  Note that the sample output given in assignment1.html shows some items in 
  red (but your output should NOT be colorized). These items may change,
  depending on who ran the program on what machine/server. i.e., the machine
  name might change, the date might change, the user list might change, the
  IP address might change, the OS might change, etc.

  If you have the PATH to the submit programs in your path, this is an example
  of you submitting your assignment ('>' is your prompt):
    > submit-cps393dwoit assign1a.sh
    > submit-cps393dwoit assign1b.sh
  If the submit programs are not in your path, this is an example 
  of you submitting your assignment:
    > /usr/courses/bin/x86_64/submit-cps393dwoit assign1a.sh
    > /usr/courses/bin/x86_64/submit-cps393dwoit assign1b.sh
  Similarly for checking that you submitted it; one of the following:
    > check-submit-cps393dwoit
    > /usr/courses/bin/x86_64/check-submit-cps393dwoit

  Note that for assign1a.sh, your program must produce output formatted
  exactly as shown in the question, i.e., all punctuation, dashes, 
  spaces etc., must be as in the example. Marks are deducted for incorrect 
  output formatting.

  For assign1a.sh, your program must NOT use temporary files; use pipes instead.
  For assign1b.sh, your program must be A SINGLE find command, with options.
