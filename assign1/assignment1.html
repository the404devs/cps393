You can view this file in a number of ways:
  <ul>
  <li> just look at this raw html (e.g, cat, more, vim, etc)
  <li> copy this file into your public_html and view it with a GUI browser (e.g., Firefox, IE)
  <li> use a text-based browser in a shell (e.g., lynx, sensible-browser, www-browser)
  <li> from a GUI desktop, use a GUI browser to view the file directly
  </ul>
<li>
Any changes/clarifications to this assignment will be given in file addendum.txt in 
directory /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/assignment/assign1/<br>
</ul>
<h2>Part a:</h2>
Write a bash shell program named <strong>assign1a.sh</strong> that uses only environment variables, pipes and 
bash commands that exist on the CS moons. You may use bash commands we studied in class, such as clear, echo, grep, etc.
You may also use other moon bash commands if necessary, such as: hostname, last, id, hostnamectl.
Do NOT use temporary files (use pipes instead).<br>
The environment variable $LOGNAME will be useful.<br><br>
When I ran the program (I am user dwoit) in early August, on thebe, my program cleared the screen,
and then produced the output below, (the part including, and between, the
lines of dashes.) <br>
Note that your program should output plain text, with NO color changes. The red color below is 
used only to identify those parts of your output that should NOT be hardcoded. Note that your program
should also clear the screen before displaying its output.<br>
<code>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
This machine is <strong><font color="red">thebe</font></strong>. <br>
<strong><font color="red">7</font></strong> users have logged into  <strong><font
color="red">thebe</font></strong>
since <strong><font color="red">Thu Aug 1</font></strong>; they are: <br>
    <strong><font color="red">aabhari,amirul,dwoit,iwoungan,mes,neshel,s4ghaffa</font></strong>. <br>
 <strong><font color="red">Thebe</font></strong> is at IP Address <strong><font
 color="red">141.117.57.46</font></strong>
 and is running <strong><font color="red">Operating System Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS</font></strong>. <br>
You are <strong><font color="red">dwoit</font></strong>, and you have logged in <strong><font
color="red">2</font></strong>
times since <strong><font color="red">Thu Aug 1</font></strong>. <br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
</code>
IMPORTANT: <br>
<ul>
<li>Your program must use only variables, pipes, and bash shell commands. 
<li>Your program must not use non-bash-command code, such as C, Python, Java, etc. 
</ul>

NON-HARDCODED PARTS:<br>
Several items must be detected by your program, and NOT hardcoded. As noted above,
these are shown above in red, but your program should NOT colorize output:
<ul>
<li>
All occurrences of the machine name (thebe, Thebe). 
<li>
The number of users. i.e., the "7" above should vary according to when assign1a.sh is run.
<li>
The date. This must be the date /var/log/wtmp begins (this date is given in the final line
  printed by the "last" command).
<li>
The list of users who have logged in since that date (as printed by the "last" command).
<li>
The IP address
<li>
The Operating System
<li>
The login name of the user running assign1a.sh (dwoit when professor ran hers, but NOT
  HARDCODED). Your program must detect the name of the user. Thus, if dmason ran dwoit's
  assign1a.sh, the program would print "You are dmason, ...", even though assign1a.sh is
  dwoit's program, is in dwoit's filespace, and is owned by dwoit.
<li>
The number of times that user has logged in since the start date (this is the number
  of lines for that user in last's output.) Note that "user" is the user running the 
  program, not necessarily the program's owner.
</ul>
The parts of the output above shown in red font should NOT be hardcoded.
The parts of the output above shown in normal (non-red) font should be hardcoded.
For example, these strings MUST be hardcoded: <br>
<pre>
"-------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
"This machine is "
" users have logged into "
"since" 
"; they are:"
etc.
</pre>


<h2>Part b:</h2>
Write a shell program named <strong>assign1b.sh</strong> that uses a <strong>find</strong> command to display
the following:<br>
<ul>
<li>
files in the filesystem in and under directory /usr/courses/cps393/dwoit/courseNotes/
<li>
  whose name ends in .h but whose name does NOT contain the lower-case letter t
<li>
  and who are in group cps393
<li>
  and have been accessed less than 75 days ago
</ul>

Your program should display the files using <strong><code>ls -dils format</code></strong>. 
This is a format similar to that of <strong><code>ls -l</code></strong>. 
You can search for the string <stront><code>ls -dils format</code></strong> in the
find man page to discover an appropriate option to use in your find command.
<br>
Your program should redirect stderr, so that any messages to stderr are not displayed.
<br>
Your program should use just a single find command to accomplish its task; do
not use pipes, other linux commands, such as ls, etc.
<p>
When dwoit ran assign1b.sh on thebe on August 20, it produced the output below.<br>
However, your output may differ because of your environment.<br>

<p>
CHEATING<br>
There are hundreds of ways to code these shell programs. If your code is too similar to
another student's code, you will both receive zero and be reported for cheating.
<hr>
SUBMIT<br>
Submit your two programs using the cps393 submit program.
<p>
<strong>To Submit:</strong> <code>submit-cps393dwoit filename</code> <br>
<strong>To Check what you've submitted: </strong> <code>check-submit-cps393dwoit</code><br>
<strong>To Check your Marks: </strong> use D2L
<p>
If the submit programs are not in your path, you can use their absolute path name, as in:<br>
<code>/usr/courses/bin/x86_64/submit-cps393dwoit filename</code>
